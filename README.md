# Matrix Code
You know that cool display in the movie "The Matrix"? The one with all the green text? This program is sort of like a replication of that display.

This program was made with python using the Pygame module. Once you run the code, the matrix code starts and covers your entire screen. To exit, just click anywhere on the screen.
